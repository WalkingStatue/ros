# Rescue Operation Simulator

## Overview

The **Rescue Operation Simulator** is a project designed to simulate autonomous agents navigating a disaster-stricken area to rescue survivors. The simulator uses the A* search algorithm to plan paths for the agent while considering obstacles and varying terrain costs.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Environment**: Define the grid size and place obstacles and survivors.
- **Autonomous Agents**: Agents navigate the grid to rescue survivors.
- **Dynamic Pathfinding**: Uses A* algorithm with optional diagonal movement and terrain costs.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Implements basic obstacle avoidance and path replanning.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual feedback of the grid and agentâ€™s movements.

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the program, run:

```bash
python main.py
```
